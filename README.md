# <Google Books Search>

## Description

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Liscense-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")

In creating this app, I was demonstrating my ability to utilize React by deploying an app with it. Also I needed to be familliar with utilizing all the resources Google gives me for free at my disposal.

To be fair, it didn't have to search for books, but I think the world needs a good TOME from time to time.

The big thing is that this project uses REACT, which a lot of people are not using to its full potential yet.

However, there was a HUGE complication I had with a node modules conflict that drove me to delete a lot of my files that conflicted.
